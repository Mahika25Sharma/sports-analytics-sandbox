# 🏏 Sports Analytics Sandbox

### 👋 Overview
This repository explores how **data engineering and analytics** can be applied to **sports (especially cricket)**.  
It contains experiments, notebooks, and mini-projects built using open datasets such as **Cricsheet**, **Kaggle Cricket Data**, and custom APIs.

---

### 🎯 Objectives
- Build clean, reproducible pipelines for cricket data (ball-by-ball, match-level, player stats).  
- Create exploratory dashboards for match trends and player performance.  
- Apply basic feature engineering and predictive modeling for runs/wickets or player impact.  

---

### 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Plotly, Scikit-learn  
- **Data Engineering:** Azure Data Factory, PySpark, Databricks  
- **Visualization:** Power BI, Streamlit  

---

### 📊 Example Ideas
- Player performance trends by opposition and venue.  
- Win probability modeling based on current run rate and wickets.  
- Player similarity clustering (e.g., batters by strike rate + consistency).
